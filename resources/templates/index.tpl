      <p>
        WeShift is a tool to help workers control their time at their workplace. With or without the cooperation of management. Shifts can be put in from spreadsheets, for ease when that's available.
      </p>
      <p>
        WeShift can also be used as a sole source of scheduling - a daily and monthly calendar of shifts is available, and timesheets can be generated that show how many hours a worker has worked (updated as shifts change), checkable against paychecks.
      </p>
      <p>
        WeShift can also be a place for workplace organizing - a simple way to get time off (if you request a shift off, anyone free during that time is contacted), but also a way to communicate anonymously / collectively about issues at the workplace - to make known that a certain shift is always overwhelmed, or that there is broken or worn out equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In the end, WeShift is a tool - you make it what you want it to be.</strong>
